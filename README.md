# asm-stackcraft-x86_64

## Overview:
This repo tries to achieve a simple introduction to assembly with basic to intermediate logic, with inline asm later on.

- `small_asm/` is for basic loops to data structures
- `replications` are a minimum section for niche commands on linux like `ls`

## Usage

```bash
make FILE=<file_path>
```
